# FindGlog.cmake - Find Google glog logging library.
#
# This module defines the following variables:
#
# GLOG_FOUND: TRUE iff glog is found.
# GLOG_INCLUDE_DIRS: Include directories for glog.
# GLOG_LIBRARIES: Libraries required to link glog.
#
# The following variables control the behaviour of this module:
#
# GLOG_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                         search for glog includes, e.g: /timbuktu/include.
# GLOG_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS: List of additional directories in which to
#                         search for glog libraries, e.g: /timbuktu/lib.
#
# The following variables are also defined by this module, but in line with
# CMake recommended FindPackage() module style should NOT be referenced directly
# by callers (use the plural variables detailed above instead).  These variables
# do however affect the behaviour of the module via FIND_[PATH/LIBRARY]() which
# are NOT re-called (i.e. search for library is not repeated) if these variables
# are set with valid values _in the CMake cache_. This means that if these
# variables are set directly in the cache, either by the user in the CMake GUI,
# or by the user passing -DVAR=VALUE directives to CMake when called (which
# explicitly defines a cache variable), then they will be used verbatim,
# bypassing the HINTS variables and other hard-coded search locations.
#
# GLOG_INCLUDE_DIR: Include directory for glog, not including the
#                   include directory of any dependencies.
# GLOG_LIBRARY: glog library, not including the libraries of any
#               dependencies.

# Called if we failed to find glog or any of it's required dependencies,
# unsets all public (designed to be used externally) variables and reports
# error message at priority depending upon [REQUIRED/QUIET/<NONE>] argument.
