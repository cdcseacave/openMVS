# OpenMVS: open Multi-View Stereo reconstruction library

## Introduction

[OpenMVS (Multi-View Stereo)](http://cdcseacave.github.io/openMVS "OpenMVS (Multi-View Stereo") is a library for computer-vision scientists and especially targeted to the Multi-View Stereo reconstruction community. While there are mature and complete open-source projects targeting Structure-from-Motion pipelines (like [OpenMVG](https://github.com/openMVG/openMVG "OpenMVG")) which recover camera poses and a sparse 3D point-cloud from an input set of images, there are none addressing the last part of the photogrammetry chain-flow. *OpenMVS* aims at filling that gap by providing a complete set of algorithms to recover the full surface of the scene to be reconstructed. The input is a set of camera poses plus the sparse point-cloud and the output is a textured mesh. The main topics covered by this project are:

- **dense point-cloud reconstruction** for obtaining a complete and accurate as possible point-cloud
- **mesh reconstruction** for estimating a mesh surface that explains the best the input point-cloud
- **mesh refinement** for recovering all fine details
- **mesh texturing** for computing a sharp and accurate texture to color the mesh
